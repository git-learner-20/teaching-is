## Teaching Information Science

### Abstract
These pages are a collection of articles and notes that currently are largely based on the very **subjective** view of Kai Eckert.

Kai is professor at Stuttgart Media University. He leads the Web-based Information Systems and Services (WISS) group and teaches in the Information Science program. By education, Kai is a computer scientist and therefore brings a very technology-centric view to the table. 

From June to August 2019, Kai travels the USA and talks to various people at various institutions, to discuss current changes and developments in the broad field of information and library science - and also to get a better understanding of developments in the past and differences between schools and countries. He is particularly interested in a comparison of program developments with recently and currently implemented changes in the information science program at Stuttgart Media University.

**Goal:** By circulating these texts and gathering feedback from as many people as possible, the subjective views here should be objectivized and the experiences generalized. 

We plan to have a public discussion at the [DCMI conference 2019 in Seoul, Korea](http://dublincore.org/conferences/2019/), among teachers and practitioners of library and information science. 

As a result of the work here and the discussion in Seoul, we would like to publish an article with the most important findings.

### How to contribute

Teaching how to use Git and how to collaborate using the open source system [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/) or the commercial [GitHub](https://github.com/) is part of many IS programs today. If you know how to do this, you will feel at home. If not, we hope you use this as an occasion to learn.

For now, here is a quick intro, [how to contribute](https://wisslab.github.io/howto-contribute.html).

### Starting Point

When Kai started to reach out to people to visit, he sent the following text, that describes his view on recent devleopments at Stuttgart Media University:
